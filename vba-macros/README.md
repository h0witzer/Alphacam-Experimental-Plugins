# VBA Macros

This directory contains VBA macros for Alphacam automation and customization.

## Structure

- **examples/** - Sample VBA macros demonstrating common operations
- **tests/** - Test files and test data for VBA macros
- **templates/** - Template files for creating new VBA macros

## Getting Started

1. Place your .chm API documentation files in the `docs/chm-files/` directory
2. Use the templates provided to create new macros
3. Reference the API documentation using the CHM reader tools in `tools/chm-reader/`

## Testing

Test files should be placed in the `tests/` directory. Each test file should correspond to a macro in the `examples/` directory and validate its functionality.

## Best Practices

- Document all macros with clear comments
- Follow VBA naming conventions
- Test macros thoroughly before deployment
- Keep macros modular and reusable
